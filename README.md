<h1>Automated Pentesting (PDF Extractions)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves automating the retrieval of PDF files from a remote web server using a custom Python script. The primary goal is to employ a brute-force approach to locate and download PDF files that adhere to a specific format on the target server. This project aims to streamline the process of collecting these PDFs efficiently.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b>
- <b>Remote Machine</b>
- <b>Nmap</b>

<h2>Environment Used </h2>

- <b>Oracle VirtualBox</b>
- <b>KaliLinux</b>

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>

Installed and setup Oracle VirtualBox, KaliLinux: <br/>

Launched an Nmap scan targeting the first 1000 ports on a remote machine's IP address:

- During the examination of the Nmap scan, I identified the presence of a web server operating on port 80

In-depth examination and analysis:

- Examining the webpage's source code, I observed a recurring pattern of PDF files that followed a consistent format: "2020-01-01-upload.pdf."
- Navigated to the documents folder but encountered a 403 - Forbidden error due to the absence of directory listings or accessible content

Employed python for automating the search process:

- The line **import requests** library  is used to send HTTP requests to the web server
- The variable **base_url = http://10.10.10.248/documents/** sets the URL for the web server where the files are hosted. The script will try to access files located under this URL
- **months()** function is responsible for iterating through the months of the year. It calls another function, **def days()**, for each month.
- **day(months)** function is responsible for iterating through the days of a given month. It constructs a filename based on the year (2020), the month, and the day, and then calls the **get_page** function to try to download the corresponding file.
- **get_page(file)** function constructs the full URL by combining the **base_url** and the filename. It then sends an HTTP GET request to that URL using **requests.get**. If the status code of the response is not 404(Not Found), it prints the URL and calls the **download_file()** function.
- **download_file()** function is responsible for saving the content of the HTTP response to a local file with the same name as the remote file. It opens the file in binary write mode ("wb") and writes the content of the response to it.
- **if __name__ == '__main__'** checks if the script is being run as the main program (not imported as a module in another script). If it is the main program, it calls the months() function to start the process of iterating through months and days.

Navigated to my current directory folder, enabling me to view all the downloaded files:
